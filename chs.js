    "You use your Illusion prowess to charm the businessman; the price is too high. You attempt to barter for the robe...\n            \n\"Hmm...\" He observes you, top to bottom. \"Ok. I will go lower. How about... 5000 coins?\"\n\n*Now* you think the price is more fair.": "你用你的幻觉能力来吸引商人； 价格太高了。 你试图以物易物换取长袍……\n \n\“嗯……”他从上到下观察着你。 \"好吧。我会降低。5000 个金币怎么样？\"\n\n*现在*你认为价格更公平。",
    "\"E-Excuse me, headmaster...?\" You hear a timid voice coming from the door. You gaze up, to find your apprentice at the door, and motion for him to come inside. He walks towards you, looking disheveled and holding a club.\n    \n\"I found a trap door in the school garden, behind some bushes\", he begins explaining. \"I found it curious, so I decided to see what was below it.\" He glances at you. You can tell that, despite his usual fear of you, he is actually quite enthusiastic about this.": "“打..打扰一下，校长……？”你听到门口传来一个胆怯的声音。 你抬头，发现你的学徒站在门口，示意他进屋。 他朝你走来，看上去衣冠不整，手里拿着一根棍子。\n \n\“我在学校花园里的一些灌木丛后面发现了一个活板门”，他开始解释道。 “我觉得它很好奇，所以我决定看看它下面是什么。”他瞥了你一眼。 你可以看出，尽管他平时很害怕你，但他实际上对此非常热心。",
    "\"It's a very spacious basement, with a lot of rooms, and it seems to go very deep!\", he says. \"Headmaster, you should definitely investigate. I feel there's a lot of secrets to be found!\"\n  \n\"B-but it was, well... dangerous\", he continues, while looking down. \"Please be prepared before going down there. There are scary... ...creatures, roaming around the place.\"": "“这是一个非常宽敞的地下室，有很多房间，而且看起来很深！”，他说。 \“校长，你绝对应该调查一下。我觉得有很多秘密有待发现！\”\n \n\“但-但是，好吧......危险\”，他低头继续说道。 \"去那里之前请做好准备。那里有可怕的......生物，在周围漫游。\"",
    "You hand over the coins and buy the robe. The businessman grins slightly. \"Great doooooing business with you!\", he exclaims, before handing the robe to you.\n                \n**You have obtained a :wizardRobe:Wizard's Robe!**": "你交出金币并购买长袍。 商人微微一笑。 \“跟你做生意太好了！\”，他在把长袍递给你之前大声说道。\n \n**你已经获得了 :巫师长袍:巫师长袍!**",
    "You nod, and bid farewell to the apprentice.\n          \nYou are aware this is quite the old building, where wizards used to live and study several generations ago. You consider the basement may be full of things that could help expand your knowledge. However, you recall the apprentice's warning: it will probably be dangerous. You strongly consider arming yourself with a weapon and some protection before heading in, though you admit you may already be equipped for it.\n\nMaybe this is why the researcher was also excited about making weapons...?\n\n**You have unlocked the \"Exploration\" feature! You can access this feature from the left-side menu. Explore various locations to discover a wide array of new things; but beware, as powerful foes may be lurking behind every corner!**": "你点点头，与学徒告别。\n \n你知道这是一座相当古老的建筑，几代人以前，巫师们曾在这里生活和学习。 您认为地下室可能充满了可以帮助您扩展知识的东西。 但是，你记得学徒的警告：这可能会很危险。 你强烈考虑在进入之前用武器和一些保护措施武装自己，尽管你承认你可能已经为此做好了准备。\n\n也许这就是为什么研究人员也对制造武器感到兴奋......？\n\n* *您已解锁“探索”功能！ 您可以从左侧菜单访问此功能。 探索不同的地点，发现各种各样的新事物； 但要小心，强大的敌人可能潜伏在每个角落！**",
    "As you continue fighting the animals that infest the school basement, you get a sudden realization. What if you actually used magic to fight back? You give it a try, and are easily able to fell one of those mice that pester you as you look around the basement.\n    \nThat was definitely powerful! You can't wait to go back and ask your researcher to start studying this. This is an entirely new school of magic of its own.\n\n**You have completed the \"Evocation\" storyline and have permanently unlocked the Evocation school! You may now do research on Evocation, which will let you learn damaging combat spells. This will persist even after restarting the game!**": "当您继续与侵扰学校地下室的动物战斗时，您突然意识到。 如果你真的用魔法反击怎么办？ 你试一试，当你环顾地下室时，很容易就能抓住一只缠着你的老鼠。\n \n这绝对是强大的！ 你迫不及待地想回去让你的研究人员开始研究这个。 这是一个全新的魔法学校。\n\n**你已经完成了“召唤”故事情节并永久解锁了 召唤 学校！ 你现在可以研究召唤，这会让你学习破坏性的战斗法术。 这甚至在重新启动游戏后仍然存在！**",
    "Felling those enemies is interesting, as sometimes you can find useful items afterwards. You have noticed, however, that they also leave behind some material that you have been calling \"Monstium\". You are not sure what it does, but it feels somewhat hazardous.\n    \nThere might be a way to store more of this... You think for a bit, and devise a larger storage unit, with more capacity than warehouses, and with a special compartment dedicated to potentially dangerous materials. To make it truly work, you think of imbuing it with mana. You are eager to give it a try.\n\n**You can now build Monstruariums!**": "击败那些敌人很有趣，因为有时您可以在之后找到有用的物品。 然而，你已经注意到，他们也留下了一些你一直称之为“妖物”的材料。 你不确定它的作用，但感觉有点危险。\n \n可能有一种方法可以存储更多这些...你想了想，设计了一个更大的存储单元，容量比仓库大，并且 有一个专门用于存放潜在危险材料的特殊隔间。 为了让它真正发挥作用，你会考虑给它注入法力。 你迫不及待地想尝试一下。\n\n**你现在可以建造 妖物宝窟 了！**",
    "A young woman, dressed as a wizarding apprentice shows up on campus with a crystal ball.\n    \n\"Headmaster, your magical prowess is known far and wide\", she says. \"Crystal balls are important magical artifacts that can be used to know the future. I would like to know my own destiny, but my skill is not strong enough. Perhaps you can help me...?\" she asks, looking at you.": "一位年轻女子，打扮成巫师学徒，拿着水晶球出现在校园里。\她说：“校长，你的魔法能力广为人知。”\“水晶球是重要的魔法物品，可以用来预测未来。我想知道自己的命运，但我的技能不够强。也许你可以帮助我……”她看着你问道。",
    "You pool together even more mana. The staff begins to shine! You feel the magical energies starting to roar. The apprentice jumps back as you cast the spell.\n            \nThe researcher keeps cheering. \"This is working!\", she screams with excitement. \"Just a little more!\"": "你汇集了更多法力。 工作人员开始发光！ 你感觉到魔法能量开始咆哮。 学徒在你施法时向后跳。\n \n研究员一直在欢呼。 “这是有效的！”，她兴奋地尖叫道。 \“只要多一点点！\”",
    "You utilize your Illusion prowess to create a fuzzy image inside the crystal ball. You pretend to be focused in divining the future as the apprentice watches in awe.\n          \nAs the illusion runs its course, you appear to exit your trance. You tell the woman that she is destined to learn magic and refine her powers at your institution. As much of a lie as it was, she falls for it.\n\n\"Wow... so that's really my destiny\", she says, while lost in thought. \"Then I should comply. ...I-I know that if you go against destiny, you will never be able to be successful... ...Can I stay here and study magic?\", she asks. You nod.\n\n**You have obtained an extra apprentice!**": "你利用你的幻觉能力在水晶球内创造一个模糊的图像。当学徒敬畏地看着你时，你假装专注于预测未来。\n \n当幻象运行时，你似乎退出了恍惚状态。你告诉这位女士，她注定要在你的机构学习魔法并提升自己的能力。尽管这是一个谎言，但她还是相信了。\n\n\“哇……这真的是我的命运”，她一边沉思一边说道\她问道：“那么我应该遵守……我知道，如果你违背命运，你将永远无法成功……我能留在这里学习魔法吗？”。你点头。\\n\n**您获得了一个额外的学徒**",
    "You use your Illusion knowledge to trick the merchant and give him 4330 fake stones. The merchant falls for it!\n          \n\"Here are your coins\", he says. \"Nice doing business with you!\". He walks away afterwards.\n\nHe will be in for a surprise later, but you are happy you got the coins!": "你用你的幻觉知识欺骗商人并给了他 4330 颗假石头。 商人上当了！\n \n\“这是你的硬币\”，他说。 \“和你合作很愉快！\”。 之后他就走开了。\n\n他稍后会给你一个惊喜，但你很高兴你得到了硬币！",
    "As you manage to defeat the powerful Skeleton, you notice what it was guarding all along: a staircase down to what seems to be... another floor? What could possibly be down here?\n  \nThe mysteries abound, and you recall what your researcher told you before. The event called Tournament of Magic. You still feel very far away from that, but through this adventure, you have already managed to discover an entire school of magic. You realize that this might just be the best way forward to actually be able to participate in the event. You arm yourself with more courage before moving on into the unknown...\n\n**You can now enter the School Basement B2! You can access this floor by pressing the \"Next Floor\" button in the Exploration screen.**": "当您设法打败强大的骷髅时，您会注意到它一直在守卫的东西：一条通往似乎是……另一层楼的楼梯？ 这里可能有什么？\n \n谜团比比皆是，你还记得你的研究人员之前告诉过你的话。 该活动称为魔术锦标赛。 你仍然觉得离那个很远，但通过这次冒险，你已经成功地发现了整个魔法学校。 您意识到这可能只是真正能够参与活动的最佳方式。 在进入未知世界之前，你要用更多的勇气武装自己……\n\n**你现在可以进入学校地下室 B2 了！ 您可以通过在探索屏幕中按“下一层”按钮来访问该楼层。**",
